Graduate student at Georgia Tech, specializing in machine learning. And a cloud solutions engineer at EY, a multinational professional services firm.

You'll find me typically working on my own pet projects. I'm deploying my own ML models in the cloud, bringing my unique perspectives to solve the problems facing humanity.

Outside of this daily tinkering, I enjoy reading, playing the piano, and competing in triathlons.

You can find my projects on GitHub: [kpath1999](https://github.com/kpath1999)
