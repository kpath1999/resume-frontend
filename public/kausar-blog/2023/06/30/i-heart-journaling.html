    <p>I started a practice in late July 2023 of daily morning pages. Each day, I aim to write about 2 pages of whatever comes to my mind. In the process, I am learning to articulate my thoughts clearly and have the logic hold up when re-read. I got this idea from Tim Ferriss on his YouTube channel, where he spoke about the importance of writing and its potential to impact just about every aspect of one’s life. I have always wanted to improve my ability to write, cogently express my thoughts about a particular topic, and share it with my readers.</p>

<p>Through practice and repetition, I can attest to how helpful this journaling habit is to me. There were many negative patterns of thought that I felt consumed by, but this most certainly helped me feel better. And not in a wrap-a-band-aid-on-it kind of way, but in a deeply therapeutic way. Freezing my thoughts into words on paper / a screen and rationalizing through every intricacy has helped me gain a lot of clarity. Otherwise, it’s really hard to arrive at these conclusions by having thoughts simmer in your head. Articulation is an integral step.</p>

<p>This applies even to goal-setting. In an attempt to land a project in my consulting job, I mapped out my networking strategy on 7/15 in my journal. The next day, I executed this plan to the tee. Lo and behold, things worked out. I’ll be starting a new project beginning next week that will be closely tied to Azure and cloud computing.</p>

<p>I recently had this desire to share my work through a blog. I’ve mostly set up the web infrastructure piece of it, using Jekyll and AWS. All of my writings have been categorized into their respective themes. Writing has helped me understand myself better and clarified the direction I’d like to take my life.</p>

<p>I’m creating this blog for myself. I won’t mind if nobody ever looks at it. That’s fine. What matters is the soul with which I put my work out. How the world perceives it is the world’s problem.</p>

        <p>Welcome to my blog! I like writing about technology, fitness, philosophy, history and just about  anything I find interesting. I&#39;m fascinated by Artificial Intelligence and where it can  lead our civilization. I hope to be part of this revolution, contributing in my own little way.</p>
