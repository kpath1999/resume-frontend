    <p>Writing this before going to bed today. It was the first day at work right after the week-long summer break. I spent half of the time networking with colleagues within my practice. I’ve been looking forward to getting involved with cloud engagements occurring at my company. Getting my name out there, helping them out, studying for certifications – these are productive ways to spend my time. No matter what happens in the future, at least I’ll be able to look back at this time and know deep down that I did what I could.</p>

<p>I haven’t been feeling too great about my job. Market conditions have driven up inflation, which has led to clients avoiding engaging in large contracts with professional services firms like ours. The result is that the partners’ hands are tied in terms of the budgets they can allow for their teams. They staff fewer individuals. I’m still in the early stages of my career, and I haven’t yet built a strong skill base. That makes it harder to staff employees like me. There isn’t a compelling case for putting me on a project, besides me being a relatively cheap resource. It is a bit disheartening, but I also know how much of this is outside my control. I will keep networking and making every effort to help out where I can. I’ve thought about this multiple times. I’m ready to accept any outcome that emerges from this. Even if I’m laid off, I can quit knowing I did everything in my power to get involved with work within the firm, made an honest effort to follow my curiosities, and interacted and collaborated with my fellow colleagues to the best of my abilities. There will come a time when I am a highly sought after resource. I know this because of all the work I put in every single day, honing my skills. Getting AWS certified, learning more about cloud computing, pursuing the Georgia Tech degree, building a strong foundation in machine learning – I think all of this will compound towards some massive gains in the future. And, more than the goal, I find the work incredibly rewarding. I feel everyday is well spent when I learn something new. I’m embarking on a wonderful journey that can only lead to positive outcomes.</p>

<p>I want to write about the importance of giving one’s best, regardless of the outcome.
When it comes to work, things are tough. Work isn’t available as much as before and it’s a struggle to stay billable. In such a situation, it is easy to get cynical and blame the company for not taking care of its employees’ development. However, feeling sorry for oneself and complaining does not do anyone any good. It’s a victim’s mindset, and it’s something I refuse to adopt. I choose to have the most positive attitude in this situation. I am networking quite actively every single day, in addition to helping out with pursuits and internal initiatives where I can. Something that I won’t compromise on is my learning, and how I prioritize upskilling. I’m really proud of the effort I put in to pass the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam. It wasn’t easy, but that’s what made it so rewarding. I will continue with this trajectory, taking more certifications and giving my best at Georgia Tech. With this mindset of showing up everyday, networking, delivering high-quality work and learning, I know I can’t go wrong. The more love you put out into the world, the more you get back.</p>

<p>I’m following a similar mindset with my triathlon training. I show up everyday, eager to put in the work. More than any particular result, I have thoroughly enjoyed the learning process. Getting better at swimming has been the most rewarding experience. Swimming 2.1 miles in Lake Michigan was incredibly empowering. The day I complete my first race swim is the day I will know that my fears were just that - fears. With enough patience and persistence, anything is possible. It really is the mindset I bring to this activity that will ultimately allow me to prevail.
As I’ve begun to lead a more respectable life, I sense a growing positive energy within me. This aura will attract the best possible people into my life. My life is rewarding simply by virtue of how I choose to lead it. What is in my control, I will execute with the finest degree of precision. Anything outside the bounds of my direct influence is none of my concern. It’s a simple principle, but incredibly powerful.</p>

<p>I am so grateful for being in a place in my life where I can be happy, peaceful, and content with the fact that I can go out everyday with a passion for life.</p>

<p>I recently came across an interesting idea - being on an information diet. I think it’s quite pertinent for the times we live in. We’re deluged with noise across social media channels and various other apps. It’s up to us to take personal responsibility and recognize the ill effects of modern media if not kept in check. I’ve always preferred reading books, learning about a subject in depth, rather than remaining at a surface level by scouring 2 minute news bites / tweets. I enjoy watching Tim Ferriss and Lex Fridman podcasts for this very reason – they’re long-form and allow you to engage with the content in an in-depth fashion.</p>

<p>I also want to take a moment to address the injuries/pains that keep creeping up in different parts of my body during triathlon training. Going into the sport, I knew there were going to be issues. First with the left shoulder, then the left quad, now the right knee after today’s run… At some point, I need to realize that this is all part of the game. How I choose to respond to these occurrences is what will ultimately define the quality/nature of my experience. In terms of the right knee, my strategy is to inform Ryan at Athletico via email tomorrow. I’ll try to schedule a session for Monday. In case he’s unable to diagnose the issue, I will ask him if he could recommend a doctor to take a look at it. Who knows, this might be an occasion where I learn more about running technique and how best I can avoid injury.</p>
